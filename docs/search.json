    "text": "Year 2023 Water Quality Data\nIn this chapter we will collate 2023 laboratory data from several sources into a single spreadsheet document with a consistent format. The desired end format is a spreadsheet template provided by the EPA Water Quality Exchange. These template files are available to download from the EPA at https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/water-quality-exchange-web-template-files.\nOnce the data is collated, it will be evaluated according to a Quality Assurance Checklist (template example provided by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation Soldotna office). Field observations that do not meet the quality assurance standards described in the evaluation checklist will be flagged as “Rejected” before being uploaded to the EPA WQX.\nData that has been uploaded to the EPA WQX is evaluated biannually by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) in their Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report1. The integrated report evaluates available water quality data from the previous five years against Alaska water quality standards and regulations (adec2020?).\n\n2023 Water Quality Data Formatting\nThe code scripts in this document assemble water quality data from the two analytical laboratories that partnered with Kenai Watershed Forum for this project in 2023:\n\nSGS Laboratories (Anchorage, AK)\nSoldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (Soldotna, AK)\n\n\n\n\n2023 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results (SGS Labs)\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2023 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - Part 1 - Electronic Data Delivery file\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2023 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - Part 2 - Electronic Data Delivery file\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2023 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2023 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - Electronic Data Delivery file\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2023 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2023 Metals/Nutrients Chain of Custody docs from SGS - PDF file\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(analytical_method)`\n\n\n–&gt; use EPA metals guidance in QA/QC rather than at this stage!\n\n\n\n2023 Fecal Coliform Lab Results (Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant Lab)\nChain of custody documents available upon request.\n\n\nvalue for \"which\" not specified, defaulting to c(\"rows\", \"cols\")\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(sample_location_rm)`\n\n\n\n\n\n2023 Total Suspended Solids Lab Results (Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP))\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2023 Total Suspended Solids Results from SWWTP\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2023 Total Suspended Solids Results from SWWTP\n\n\nChain of custody documents available upon request\n\n\nNew names:\nNew names:\n• `` -&gt; `...9`\n• `` -&gt; `...18`\n\n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.\nℹ In argument: `time_sampled = format(...)`.\nCaused by warning in `as.POSIXct()`:\n!

The draft Data Evaluation Checklist Template (available for download below) outlines these questions:\n\n\nDownload 2023 Draft Kenai Baseline Data Evaluation Checklist Template\n\n\nDownload results pre-QA/QC; including lab QA QC info\n\nPre-database\n\nOverall project success\n1.) Were the appropriate analytical methods used for all parameters?\nYes. Analytical methods from the approved 2023 QAPP were employed, with exceptions that are not anticipated to affect results (see below).\nChanges from the approved 2023 occurred, including:\n\nFor summer 2023, a laboratory method used to analyze total metals differed slightly from that specified on the QAPP. EPA method 200.8 was used for total metals rather than 200.7. The project manager at SGS Laboratories in Anchorage, AK describes that no differences are anticipated in how results can be interpreted. Both methods are appropriate for total metals in surface waters.\n\n\n2.) Were there any deviations from the sampling plan?\nIn 2023 there were several small deviations from the sampling plan due to a late ice-out date and challenging spring field logistics. One site in spring 2023 could not be accessed for sampling due to low water conditions (Kenai River main stem, RM 10.1). As a result there are no samples from this site/date. Additionally, one fecal coliform sample result is missing from site RM 40 (Killey River) on 5/2/2023 due to an on-site loss from bottle spillage.\n\n3.) Were field duplicates, blanks, and/or other field QC samples collected as planned?\nYes, all planned field blanks, trip blanks, and duplicate samples were collected as planned.\n\n4.) Do the laboratory reports provide results for all sites and parameters?\nThe laboratory reports from both labs provide results corresponding with the chain of custody documents provided, within the parameters of what is described in questions #1 - #3.\n\n5.) Is a copy of the COC included with the laboratory reports?\nYes. Chain of custody documents from SGS laboratories are included in the results PDFs linked above. Chain of custody documents from the Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant are linked below:\n\n\nDownload 2023 Chain of Custody Documents from Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\n\n\n6.) Do the laboratory reports match the COC and requested methods throughout?\nYes, with the exceptions discussed in question #1. The SGS project manager describes that no change is anticipated for how to interpret results.\n\n7.) Are the number of samples on the laboratory reports the same as on the COC?\nYes, no loss of samples occurred in the process of generating laboratory results.\n\n8.) Was all supporting info provided in the laboratory report, such as reporting limits for all analyses and definitions?\nSGS laboratory reports include reporting limits in both the electronic data deliverables as well as the PDF reports. Results from the Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant do not contain reporting limits. Reporting limits and other QA/QC data considerations are provided in the 2023 QAPP.\n\n9.) Are site names, dates, and times correct and as expected?\nNumerous corrections to site names and dates were necessary to prepare data into final form. Original documents (Electronic Data Deliverables) were not modified, and corrections are applied throughout the data read-in process using R coding script in this document.\n\n10.) Were there any issues with instrument calibration?\nNo issues are documented with calibration for KWF’s field or laboratory instruments. No calibration issues are described in the “Case Narrative” sections of the spring and summer SGS PDF laboratory reports.\n\n11.) Did the instrument perform as expected?\nTBD with KWF results.\n\n12.) Was instrument calibration performed according to the QAPP and instrument recommendations?\nYes.\n\n13.) Was instrument verification during the field season performed according to the QAPP and instrument recommendations?\nFor water temperature probes, instrument verification rather than calibration is performed. An ice-bath test was performed on all water temperature probes according to methods described in Mauger et al. 2015 prior to field use, and all probes recorded values within 0.25 degrees Celsius of a NIST certified thermometer.\n\n14.) Were instrument calibration verification logs or records kept?\nYes. Calibration and verification records are kept at Kenai Watershed Forum’s office at 44129 Sterling Hwy, Soldotna, AK and are available upon request.\n\n15.) Do the instrument data files site IDs, time stamps and file names match?\nInstrument data files from fieldwork are not generated as part of this project.\n\n16.) Is any in-situ field data rejected and why?\nTBD … see question ###\n\n17.) Were preservation, hold time, and temperature requirements met?\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(result_analytical_method_id)`\n\n\nWe calculated time from sample field collection to lab receipt as documented in 2023 lab reports. All 2023 samples were within holding times specified in the QAPP.\nIn the field, all samples were stored in coolers with ice packs at 4 degrees C until arrival at the laboratory. In the results from SGS laboratories, two individual observations include the asterisk “*” in the “result_qualifier” column. This indicates that “the sample was warm when received.” These observations correspond not to sample handling in the field and delivery to the laboratories, but rather to internal laboratory procedures used for method blank measurements. The laboratory case narrative does not indicate that any individual sample results would be affected.\nHold time result calculations are available in the downloadable table below in the right-most columns.\n\n\nDownload 2023 kenai River Baseline Water Quality Samples Hold Times\n\n\n\n18.) Are dissolved metal quantities less than total metals quantities?\nDissolved metals observations are not consistently lower that total metals observations in 2023 data. For 2023 results, a total of 52 instances exist where dissolved metals observations are paired with total metals observations. These consist exclusively of copper and zinc observations. Of the the 52 paired observations, in 32 instances dissolved metals valules are greater than total metals values.\nThese results may have important implications for data-flagging decisions as final results are prepared for upload to the EPA Water Quality Exchange.\n\n19.) Are the duplicate sample(s) RPD within range described in QAPP?\nIn 2023, field duplicate samples were collected at two sites on both 5/2/2023 and 7/18/2023:\n\n5/2/2023\n\nKenai City Docks (RM 1.5) (ID #10000002)\nMoose River (RM 36.0) (ID #10000026)\n\n7/18/2023\n\nNo Name Creek (RM 00.0) (ID #10000008)\nMoose River (RM 36.0) (ID #10000026)\n\n\nOnly results that are meaningfully representative of the physical sample may be used for RPD calculations. Following the example in the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation 2021 Kenai River Metals Field Report (Apsens and Petitt 2022): “… a set of paired samples was evaluated for RPD only if:\n\na.) one or both of the samples were above the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ); AND if\nb.) one or both of the samples were at least two times the LOQ.”\n\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(monitoring_location_id, activity_start_date)`\nJoining with `by = join_by(monitoring_location_id, activity_start_date,\ncharacteristic_name, result_unit, result_sample_fraction)`\n\n\nA csv file of Relative Percent Difference values organized by site, date, and parameter may be downloaded below:\n\n\nRelative Percent Difference Values for Duplicate Sample Observations, 2023\n\n\nNomenclature note: “Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)”, as used by ADEC and SGS, is equivalent to another term used by EPA CDX, “Lower Quantitation Limit,” which is used in this assessment. A memo from SGS detailing nomenclature and interpretation of reporting limits can be downloaded at the link below:\n\n\nDownload DL, LOD, LOQ Interpretation.pdf\n\n\nTKA interpretation of RPD values\n\n20.) Were there any laboratory discrepancies, errors, data qualifiers, or QC failures (review laboratory duplicates, matrix spikes and blanks)?\nYes, there were. They are listed below:\nLaboratory discrepancies, errors\n\nSample collection date\n\nThe SGS PDF report shows some samples as collected on 5/3/2022. All field samples were in fact collected on 5/2/2023. An error of pre-printed dates on page 1 of the SGS chain of custody was responsible for this error. We applied the time/date correction as part of the data read-in script.\n\nSample receipt time/date to SGS laboratories\n\nThe SGS Electronic Data Deliverable (EDD; spreadsheet) of results shows 5/9/2023 as the receival date for all spring project samples (sample_type = “PS”), and time of day is not specified. However, the PDF report for these same results indicates all samples were in fact received on 5/04/23 08:51, which is consistent with the chain of custody docs. We applied the time/date correction as part of the intake script.\n\nField site names\n\nBoth of the laboratory’s results contained miscellaneous spellings and formats of site names that were inconsistent with of the needs of preparing data for the EPA CDX. These were corrected in the intake script by use of matching tables csv files, which can be viewed in the project GitHub repository under the directory”other/input/2023/misc”.\n\n\nData qualifiers, QC failures (review laboratory duplicates, matrix spikes and blanks)\n\nData qualifiers\n\nTwo instances of internal laboratory QC checks report, “sample was warm when received,” for one matrix spike duplicate (copper) and one method blank (zinc). While these data qualifiers do not affect the result of any individual field observations, it may be important to note this qualifier in the context of interpreting laboratory data for copper and zinc.\n\nQC failures\n\nNo lab QC failures are reported from Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant for fecal coliform or total suspended solids\nLab QC failures are listed on Listed on page 2 of the spring and summer SGS PDF reports\n\nSpring 2023\n\nZinc: Two dissolved zinc method blanks (200.8) (MB) are above the Limit of Quantitation of 10.0 ug/L. One method blank (MB) is at 11.3 ug/L, the other at 15.9 ug/L. As a result, dissolved zinc results from spring 2023 may need to be flagged for QC failure. PLAN: review 2021 ADEC report.\nTotal Nitrate/Nitrite: One matrix spike duplicate sample for total nitrate/nitrite is outside of QC criteria. The range of permissible recovery values includes the range from 90% - 110%, and the value is listed at 89%. This QC failure does not suggest a mechanism by which sample values are not still representative of environmental conditions, and will not result in spring 2023 total nitrate/nitrate values being flagged for QC failure.\n\nSummer 2023\n\nOne matrix spike sample for total nitrate/nitrite is outside of QC criteria. The range of permissible recovery values includes the range from 90% - 110%, and the value is listed at 112%. This QC failure does not suggest a mechanism by which sample values are not still representative of environmental conditions, and will not result in spring 2023 total nitrate/nitrate values being flagged for QC failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n** 21.) Is any laboratory data rejected and why? **\nTKA _&gt; check out 2021 example discussion, probably dissolved Cu and Zn\n\n** 22.) During the field season, review raw data files (EDDs, instrument records) as they are received. Document changes and corrections to methods as needed. **\nChanges and corrections to EDDs are documented and described throughout this series of questions.\n\n** 23.) Is the dataset complete and did you receive the expected number of results? **\nYes, we received the anticipated number of results.\n\n** 24.) Was the data collected representative of environmental conditions? **\nData that is unlikely to represent environmental conditions is identified and flagged as part of this data QA/QC review process.\n\n** 25.) Does project meet Completeness Measure A criteria? **\nFrom the QAPP, Completeness Measure A: “the primary number of samples collected divided by the usable number of samples submitted to ADEC, with a goal of 85% completeness.” (Note that as of 2023 results are now submitted directly to EPA rather than DEC, per request of DEC).\nFrom the QAPP, Completeness Measure A: “the primary number of samples collected divided by the usable number of samples submitted to ADEC, with a goal of 85% completeness.” (Note that as of 2023 results are now submitted directly to EPA rather than DEC, per request of DEC).\n(Note: metals parameters not specified in the QAPP are excluded from these analyses. In 2021, SGS laboratories provided dissolved metals results for parameters beyond what was originally requested.)\nWe calculated Completeness Measure A at the following project scales:\n\nFor individual parameters\nFor individual sites\nAs a project whole\n\n\n** 26.) Does project meet Completeness Measure B criteria? **\nFrom the QAPP, Completeness Measure B: “the planned number of samples divided by the useable samples (submitted to ADEC) with a goal of 60%.”\nFor these calculations, we will consider “usable” as “unflagged,” and will calculate at the following scales:\n\nFor individual parameters (analysis methods)\nFor individual sites\nAs a project whole\n\n\n** 27.) Was the QA Officer consulted for any data concerns? **\nKenai Watershed Forum consulted with staff from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and EPA Region 10 Office in order to prepare 2023 field data and confirm field methods and data QA/QC procedures.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Prep\n** 28.) Are the correct monitoring locations associated with the project? **\nWe used the leaflet package to generate a map of unique sites from the 2023 dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** 29.) Are the QAPP and other supporting documents attached? **\nThe 2023 QAPP is available to download at the link below, and will be attached in the upload to EPA CDX:\n\n\nDownload KenaiWatershedForum_QAPP_v3_2023.pdf\n\n\n\n** 30.) Is all metadata correct? **\nTKA\n\n** 31.) Is the organization ID correct? **\nKenai Watershed Forum’s Organization ID in the EPA Water Quality Exchange is “Kenai_WQX.” This value is manually confirmed during the upload process.\n\n** 32.) Are the time zones consistent and correct (AKDT in summer)? **\nYes.\n\n** 33.) Are all media types included? Media types appropriate to Characteristic? **\n“Water” is the only media type considered in this project. All “Characteristics” (parameters) are measured from water samples or in-situ water conditions.\n\n** 34.) Check Sample Collection, Preparation and Preservation Methods, Thermal Preservative, Equipment ID, Activity Media. Is supporting information included and correct? **\n\n\nDownload supporting info on 2023 sample collecion & preservation\n\n\n\n** 35.) Are all expected activity types present and are QC samples correctly identified? **\n\n\nDownload supporting info on 2023 activity types\n\n\n\n** 36.) Is the Activity media subdivision filled in (if relevant)? **\n“Activity media subdivision” is solely “Surface water” in the 2023 dataset.\n\n** 37.) For Water activity media, is the relative depth filled in? **\nYes, all samples are listed at an approximate depth of 15 cm.\n\n** 38.) Is the number of results for each Characteristic correct? **\nQuestions #2 and #3 address this topic in detail. A summary table of the total number of observations for each characteristic is available in the downloadable table below.\n\n\nDownload Observation Count by Characteristic, 2023 Kenai River Baseline Water Quality\n\n\n\n** 39.) Do the range of result values make sense? **\nPrior to upload to the EPA WQX, the range of results will be evaluated visually and numerically in each characteristic-specific section of the comprehensive report, relative to past results. Likely outliers will be identified and recorded in a dedicated spreadsheet (download below). Each likely outlier will have accompanying notes discussing the choice, and a decisions as to whether a more detailed statistical investigation is warranted.\n\n** 40.) Are units correct and consistent for each parameter? **\n\n\n  unique.z.result_unit.\n1                  ug/l\n2                  mg/L\n3                     %\n4             cfu/100ml\n\n\n\n** 41.) Are detection limits and laboratory qualifiers included for analytical results? **\nLaboratory qualifiers including “J” (below limit of quantitation; is an estimate), “=”, (observed value), “U” (below detection limit), and “ND” (Not Detected) are included in the column titled “result_qualifier.”\nDetection limits and their corresponding units are included in columns titled “result_detection_limit_type_1” and in “result_detection_limit_unit_1” corresponding to Limit of Quanititation, and in columns titled “result_detection_limit_type_2” and “result_detection_limit_unit_2” corresponding to Method Detection Level.\n\n42.) Are results trip blanks and/or field blanks above detection limits, and is any related data flagged as a result?\nIn summer 2023, trip blanks were included with those field crews tasked with collection water samples for hydrocarbon analyses. Sites visited by these crews include RM 1.5 - Kenai City Dock, RM 6.5 - Cunningham Park, RM 40 - Bing’s Landing, and RM 43 - Upstream of Dow Island.\n(any equivalent 2023 concerns?)\nOn the summer 2021 SGS chain of custody documents, BTEX trip blanks are specified for the above sites. However in the reported results, a single sample named “Trip Blank” is reported. This error resulted from a mis-communication with SGS staff.\nIn this case, all hydrocarbon results in the Trip Blank are reported as below detection limit, suggesting there is not a need to flag summer 2021 hydrocarbon results.\n(true for 2023?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApsens, S, and J Petitt. 2022. “Kenai River, Alaska Field Report 2021.”",

Branden,

Here is the data from yesterday’s sampling event.  There was only one problem that I noticed, it is with 
the RM 1.5 sample and dup.  The sample was in the 400mg/L range and the dup was 150mg/L 
range.  That is not a good Relative Percent Difference (RPD).  I took a picture of the samples showing the 
amount of sediment in each sample and you will see why the difference in concentration.  

Oh and Go COAL!

Peace,
James Trissel

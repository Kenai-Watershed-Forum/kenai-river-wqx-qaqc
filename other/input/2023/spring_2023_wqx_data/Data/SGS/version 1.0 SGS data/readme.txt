Desired:

be able to look @ total & dissolved cu & zn below Rm 30, and in field blanks

Hi Justin,

Thanks for checking in. I did a quick review the results from our 5/3/2023 sampling event. The work looks great. If I'm not too late, there is one clarification I'll share. I'd like to inculde an additional analysis two of the samples provided. (I believe we're still in the 14 day window from report publication.)

There are two Field Blank samples that do not have total Cu or Zn values reported from the 200.7 analyses. These two samples are, "RM 12.5-PILLARS-FIELD BLANK" and "RM 0-NO NAME CREEK-FB."

If possible I would like to have total Cu and Zn values from these two samples.
